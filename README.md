## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard i18n internationalization support</dt>
  <dd>Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.</dd>

  <dt>Offline-first</dt>
  <dd>The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.</dd>

  <dt>Static code analysis</dt>
  <dd>Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.</dd>

  <dt>SEO</dt>
  <dd>We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>

  <dt>Storybook Support</dt>
  <dd>Get storybook setup out of the box in the boilerplate. Learn more about storybook <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">here</a>.

  For easy use and development of stories in our boilerplate, follow these [instructions](docs/general/storybook.md).
</dd>
<dt>Google Analytics</dt>
  <dd>Google Analytics support is given in the boilerplate. This feature is optional and is based on requirement, so not merged in main branch.
  Support for Google Analytics can be found in <b>feature/18-Analytics-Tools</b> branch.
  </dd>
<dt>Hooks Support</dt>
  <dd>Boilerplate supports hooks and all current examples are converted to hooks. This feature is optional and is based on requirement, so not merged in main branch.
  Support for Hooks can be found in <b>feature/12-Hooks-Support</b> branch.
  </dd>
</dl>

But wait... there's more!

- _The best test setup:_ Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
  changes. (Seen a react app with 100% test coverage before?)
- _Native web app:_ Your app's new home? The home screen of your users' phones.
- _The fastest fonts:_ Say goodbye to vacant text.
- _Stay fast_: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
  line!
- _Catch problems:_ AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
  tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.

There’s also a <a href="https://vimeo.com/168648012">fantastic video</a> on how to structure your React.js apps with scalability in mind. It provides rationale for the majority of boilerplate's design decisions.

## Commit Tools Setup

For commit, we use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) so the commit messages are in the same format for all the developers. This formatted messages are used in to create change logs.

1. Install Globally Commitizen `npm install -g commitizen`
2. Install Adapter `npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog`
3. Set as default adapter for your projects `echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc`
4. Usage: now instead of using `git commit` use `git cz`
5. If you want to use commit messages with emojis you can use following package
6. Install Adapter `npm install --global cz-emoji`
7. Set as default adapter for your projects `echo '{ "path": "cz-emoji" }' > ~/.czrc`
