## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

But wait... there's more!

- _The best test setup:_ Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
  changes. (Seen a react app with 100% test coverage before?)
- _Native web app:_ Your app's new home? The home screen of your users' phones.
- _The fastest fonts:_ Say goodbye to vacant text.
- _Stay fast_: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
  line!
- _Catch problems:_ AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
  tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.

Thereâ€™s also a <a href="https://vimeo.com/168648012">fantastic video</a> on how to structure your React.js apps with scalability in mind. It provides rationale for the majority of boilerplate's design decisions.

## Commit Tools Setup

For commit, we use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) so the commit messages are in the same format for all the developers. This formatted messages are used in to create change logs.

1. Install Globally Commitizen `npm install -g commitizen`
2. Install Adapter `npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog`
3. Set as default adapter for your projects `echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc`
4. Usage: now instead of using `git commit` use `git cz`
5. If you want to use commit messages with emojis you can use following package
6. Install Adapter `npm install --global cz-emoji`
7. Set as default adapter for your projects `echo '{ "path": "cz-emoji" }' > ~/.czrc`
