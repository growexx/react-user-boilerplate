### Two Factor Authentication

1. Two factor authentication is implemented out of box in the boilerplate. To start using the feature just checkout in **feature/two-factor-authentication** branch.

2. Two factor authentication in boilerplate is supported with otp.

3. We are using open source `react-otp-input` package for OtpComponent.

4. OtpComponent is added in **(app/components/OtpComponent)**.

5. For demo purpose, an example of capturing otp and integration of OtpComponent is added in **(app/containers/Auth/TwoFactorAuthentication)**.
