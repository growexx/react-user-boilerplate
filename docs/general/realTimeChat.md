# ***How to use the feature***

  

  

- First off, head over to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click the **“Add project”** option.

- Next, enter a name for the project.

- Next, we have to get the configuration details down for our project. So, click on the web icon in the dashboard.

- Then, enter a name for the app and click **Register app**.

- Next up, copy and store the configuration details on the next screen in a safe place. That will come in handy in the next step.

  

- Now, use these keys to add ENV values in the project.

  

- Following is the list of env values needed.

  

1. REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY

  

  

2. REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN

  

  

3. REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID

  

  

4. REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET

  

  

5. REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID

  

  

6. REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID

  

- Here, for real time chat we are using cloud firestore database by firebase.

- Now, head to firebase and select the ‘Database’ option from the left-hand navigation and select ‘Create database’ on the Firestore cta.

- Whilst in development, we’ll relax the security preferences to allow _‘read’_ & _‘writes’_ to our database. _This will need to be addressed prior to any publishing of your app for obvious security reasons._

- Once enabled, you’ll be presented with your new database. Leave it for now and jump to App.

  

- Login with the email id and password of your choice.

- Make sure to login with two different users, so that real-time-chat feature can be tested.

- Go to real time chat from left menu and let the component load.

- Search for the user from dropdown and start the chat.
